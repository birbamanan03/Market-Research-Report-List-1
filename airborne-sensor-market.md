<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airborne Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Scanning</li><li>Scanning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The airborne sensor market can be divided into two primary types: non-scanning and scanning sensors. Non-scanning sensors capture images or data from a fixed field of view, typically providing high-resolution snapshots of specific areas, suitable for applications like environmental monitoring and agriculture. In contrast, scanning sensors move across a landscape, continuously collecting data over larger areas. This type is often employed in mapping, surveillance, and search-and-rescue operations, offering broad coverage but potentially lower resolution per snapshot.</p></p>
