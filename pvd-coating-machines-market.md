<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PVD Coating Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Evaporation Category</li><li>Sputtering Category</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) coating machines are categorized primarily into two types: evaporation and sputtering. Evaporation involves heating materials until they vaporize, allowing them to condense onto a substrate, creating a thin film. This method is often used for applications requiring high purity coatings. Sputtering, on the other hand, utilizes ionized gas to eject atoms from a target material, depositing them onto the substrate. It offers better adhesion and uniformity, making it suitable for more complex coatings.</p></p>
