<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suture Thread Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Short-term Absorbable</li><li>Mid-term Absorbable</li><li>Long-term Absorbable</li><li>Non-Absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The suture thread market is categorized into four types based on absorbability. Short-term absorbable sutures dissolve within weeks, ideal for quick-healing wounds. Mid-term absorbable sutures last a bit longer, dissolving in several weeks to months, suitable for moderate tissue repair. Long-term absorbable sutures are designed to remain intact for several months before absorption, used for deeper tissue closure. Non-absorbable sutures are permanent and provide lasting support, often employed in external skin closures or in areas requiring long-term stability.</p></p>
